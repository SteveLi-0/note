# multi-agent forward simulation
## 1. EPOSILON
However, afterdecoupling prediction and planning, it is problematic to accountfor the impact of the ego vehicleâ€™s future motion on the otheragents. 
By contrast, our method couples the prediction insidethe behavior planning, where each potential scenario consideredby the planner has its own corresponding future anticipation.
### simple model-based driver model
#### IDM
The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is a commonly used car-following model to simulate the behavior of vehicles in traffic flow. The acceleration \( \dot{v} \) of a vehicle is given by:

\[
\dot{v} = a \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{v}{v_0} \right)^\delta - \left( \frac{s^*(v, \Delta v)}{s} \right)^2 \right]
\]

where

\[
s^* = s_0 + max(0, vT + \frac{v \Delta v}{2 \sqrt{ab}})
\]

Here are the parameters and their meanings:



\( v \): The current speed of the vehicle (m/s).
\( v_0 \): The desired speed of the vehicle (m/s).
\( a \): The maximum acceleration (m/s\(^2\)).
\( b \): The comfortable deceleration (m/s\(^2\)).
\( \delta \): The acceleration exponent (typically set to 4).
\( s \): The current gap to the leading vehicle (m).
\( s_0 \): The minimum gap (m), a small constant to prevent division by zero and to ensure a safe distance.
\( T \): The safe time headway (s), representing the desired time gap between vehicles.
\( \Delta v \): The speed difference to the leading vehicle (m/s), defined as \( \Delta v = v - v_{\text{lead}} \).
